Do not mix up web server and server:
- A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.


web server :
A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
and other protocols to respond...

1/ On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software
and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets,
and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data
interchange with other devices connected to the web.

2/ On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users
access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software
that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages)
An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores,
and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
